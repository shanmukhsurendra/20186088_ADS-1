Yes, it is legal.
If the equals method is implemented as per the contract and the hashcode method returns a constant value, 
then we will still be able to retrieve the value for the key from a hashMap, 
but the performance will be slow compared to the method returning a unique hashcode. 
This is because internally all the keys will be stored in the same bucket, and the hashmap implementation 
needs to verify the equality against all the keys present in the hashmap.
